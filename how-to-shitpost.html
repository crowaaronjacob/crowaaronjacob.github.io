            <p>shitposting. memes. ragebait.</p>

            <p>these days, lots of people are trying to grow on platforms like X (twitter). especially people in tech/startups. the reason for this is two-fold in my eyes.</p>

            <p>1. personal gain. there's a lot to gain from having an audience. people in tech are the most capable of launching a product. that's the cold hard truth. if you're able to get 10-100k people to like you and opt into seeing your posts, you are probably 10x more likely to have a successful business. it's much harder to get users to use a product than it is to build the product in 90% of cases.</p>

            <p>2. for fun. some people just want to have somewhere to share their work. their wins, losses, highs, lows, and day to day thoughts.</p>

            <p>i'm not going to pretend that i'm the second one, a shining light amongst the sea of grifters. in fact, i think most people are a mixture of both of these. some moreso than others. i started as the first, but i'm enjoying the second one, and being anonymous, more than i could have ever imagined.</p>

            <p>pure shitposting, which i consider as memes, ragebait, and dumb jokes, fall more into the second category. funny enough, it's also the best way to get engagement (besides being an attractive person). it's near impossible to fake being genuinely funny or interesting though.</p>

            <p>people seem to have a nose for this. you can tell when someone is just reposting memes or controversial takes or copying others' posts. i see you. others see you. it's not that you're not funny or that you aren't original. it's that you're not putting in the effort. you're taking the what seems like the easiest possible path towards success.</p>

            <p>if growing an audience was easy, everyone would do it. these are the people who are trying to do this, but also not wanting to put REAL effort into their work. real creativity. real practice. 10,000 hours. 10,000 posts.</p>

            <p>if you want to get good at shitposting, making memes, or even just posting technical content, you have to put in the reps. nobody is born with the ability to write interesting technical content, or having the sense for making killer original memes.</p>

            <p>by spending countless hours reading and making these things, the people you want to be like have developed a sixth sense for their medium. it's not something you can explain in words. it's something you have to earn.</p>

            <p>i'm by no means an expert at any of these things. i've grown a handful of social media accounts on twitter, instagram, youtube, and tiktok to around a few thousand followers each. not that that's an impressive feat, but it's one many people aren't able to achieve.</p>

            <p>the way i got there wasn't luck. it was by working on my posts every single day. looking at others posts. seeing how i could take their approaches and apply them to my own work.</p>

            <p>shitposting on X is a lot of fun. it's my favorite platform by far and i've only just started on my journey. as of writing this i have almost 1.5k followers, most of which were gained in my first (this past) month - an incredible feeling. i'm looking forward to the ups and downs of growth, and to helping others with their journeys as well.</p>

            <p>thanks for reading. if you want advice feel free to DM me.</p>

            <p>if you want to know how to grow, just reply 100x a day on different people's posts (large and small) and try to post 10 times a day. doesn't matter if they are good. you'll figure out what works.</p>
